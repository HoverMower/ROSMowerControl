# ROSMowerControl

Web Control UI of ROSMower

This repository contains a Web UI to monitor and control ROSMower. I searched a while but couldn't find any ready-to use Web based UI, so I decided to build one.

Functions (not implemented yet):
- show messages of /rosout
- display different messages / topics
- publish to topics by simple UI elements i.e. buttons
- call services by simple UI elements i.e. buttons
- teleoperation
- camera view
- map view, interaction with robot by clicking on map

# Pre-requisites
To run the control center

# Configuration

# Installation and start

## Credits
This project is based on two main open source projects. The first and major one is the [Robot Web Tools project](http://robotwebtools.org/). This package is responsible for any communication and interaction with ROS.

The next project is openUI5 provided by SAP. Yes I mean that SAP, which provides ERP systems. But they also provide us with a great UI toolkit containig any control (buttons, lists) I need. As I have to use this toolkit on my daily work as well, it was more a fun project to check, if I can use it here as well.
This project has been generated with ðŸ’™ and [easy-ui5](https://github.com/SAP)
